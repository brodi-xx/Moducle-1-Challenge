# Refactored Code for Accessibility - Horiseon

## Original Code
The HTML and CSS starter files which were provided needed revamping. Some of the issues were:

The starter HTML code was missing semantic elements and was not optimized for accessibility.
The CSS code had repeating selectors and properties which needed to be consildated and organized.
The webpage had a broken link which needed to be fixed.

## Refactored Code
 The steps I took to resolve the issues are as follows:

Provided a unique title and description meta to make the website stand out on SERPs.
-Removed/replaced div elements in HTML code with more semantic elements including header, main, nav, and aside.
-Consolidated CSS selectors and properties by adding/changing classes/ids in elements with repeated styling.
-Utilized classes and ids that would support/withstand future alterations and additions to the page.
-Added commentation to CSS file.
-Fixed broken link in HTML.
