# Refactored Code for Accessibility - Horiseon

## Original Code
The HTML and CSS starter files which were provided needed revamping. Some of the issues were:
<br>
<li>The starter HTML code was missing semantic elements and was not optimized for accessibility.
<li>The CSS code had repeating selectors and properties which needed to be consildated and organized.
<li>The webpage had a broken link which needed to be fixed.
<br>
<br>

## Refactored Code

<br>
 The steps I took to resolve the issues are as follows:
<br>
<li>Provided a unique title and description meta to make the website stand out on SERPs.
<li>Removed/replaced div elements in HTML code with more semantic elements including header, main, nav, and aside.
<li>Consolidated CSS selectors and properties by adding/changing classes/ids in elements with repeated styling.
<li>Utilized classes and ids that would support/withstand future alterations and additions to the page.
<li>Added commentation to CSS file.
<li>Fixed broken link in HTML.
